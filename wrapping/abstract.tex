We advance the Coupled Cluster method's foray into the time-dependent realm, 
by implementing a robust solver based in the orbital-adaptive time-dependent 
Coupled Cluster (OATDCC)\cite{kvaal2012ab}.
This involves implementing both a simplified static
orbital time-dependent coupled cluster solver with single and double excitations 
(TDCCSD) and an oarbital-adaptive scheme with double excitations (OATDCCD).
To supplement the time-dependent methods we implement several ground state 
solvers based on the Lagrangian Coupled Cluster formulation, with single and double 
excitations, as well as a non-orthogonal orbital-optimised Coupled Cluster (NOCC)
solver\cite{myhre2018demonstrating}.

We construct several quantum dot basis sets with different potential functions
in one- and two dimensions, including interactions with magnetic fields.
What is more, we also implemet an 
interface with popular quantum chemistry software moduler for extraction of additional 
basis sets for atoms and molecules. The quantum systems are allowed to vary with time 
by addition of a time-dependent addition to the Hamiltonian, with which we simulate 
a laser field in the dipole approximation.

As a validation we reproduce results from the scientific literature, both for 
atoms, molecules and quantum dots. We show that our methods leads to convergence in 
the ever-increasing basis set size limit, for simple quantum dot systems. For the 
same quantum dot system, we show the sensitivity of the system to the frequency of 
a driving oscillating field. Frequencies closer to the resonant frequency 
leads to exctiations and increased energy. For all quantum dot system we find 
strong comformity with the harmonic potential theorem, but see slight many-body 
effect for a two-dimensional double dot system. The two-dimensional quantum dots 
with influenced by a homogoenous, static magnetic field in the form of an angular 
momentum operator, shows a split in the dipole spectrum of the system. This
frequency difference is the same as the Larmor frequency of the magnetic field,
within acceptable tolerance levels.
