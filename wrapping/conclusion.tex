\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

It went quite well. More stuff can be done.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Done much. Many particles. Large systems.
    \item Results in accordance with theory. HPT incl magnetic field.
    \item Not black box. Not for non-experts. Cannot blindly trust results.
        High overlap, amplitude norms..
    \item Only scratched the surface. Heavy computations. Much time in development.
    \item More analysis: OA vs non-OA discrepancies. Basis set effects.
    \item Further development: More terms in H. S, S-L, S-S. 
        Multi-pole terms in laser field. Double well: more reasonable basis sets.
\end{itemize}
