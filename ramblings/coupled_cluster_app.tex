\chapter{Coupled Cluster}

Here we present some supplementary material to the coupled cluster method and 
theory that we did not see fit to include in either \autoref{ch:coupled_cluster_theory},
on coupled cluster theory, or \autoref{ch:impl_coupled_cluster}, on the implementation 
of the coupled cluster methods. Nevertheless, these extra pieces of informations can 
be useful contained herein. First, we show the relation between a truncated coupled cluster wavefcuntion and
the configuration interaction expansion. Second, we derive the Slater-Condon rules, and 
third, use them to derive the Coupled Cluster Doubles (CCD) equations. Fourth, 
we provide the Coupled Cluster Singles Doubles (CCSD) equations, from the 
Lagrangian formulation, written out in full. Fifth, we provide the CCSD Langraian 
functional in its full form. Sixth and last, we provide the $\kappa$ equations that 
are used in the Non-orthogonal Orbital-optimised Coupled Cluster (NOCC) scheme.
