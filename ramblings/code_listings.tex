\chapter{Code Listings}

Here we present a few select code listings that did not fit naturally into the 
main text, but are quite useful. We provide a python function that computes the 
analytical values of the Coulomb integral in two
dimensions \cite{anisimovas1998energy}. Moreover, we present two 
functions that interfaces with and retrieves basis sets from the quantum chemistry
libraries Psi4 \cite{parrish2017psi4} and PySCF \cite{PYSCF}.
