\section{Instantaneous dipole in $H_2$}

\citeauthor{li2005time}\cite{li2005time} employ a time-dependent Hartree-Fock 
apporach in order to study the electronic optical response of molecules 
in intense fields. To be specific, they model the hydrogen molecule $H_2$ 
with a \lstinline{6-311++G(d,p)} basis set, subject to an oscillating field 
of $1.72\times10^13\text{ W} \text{cm}^{-2}$ and $456\text{ nm}$. They find the time-dependent
Hartree-Fock method to be nearly indistinguishable from calculations using the 
full time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We have managed to replicate the 
instantaneous dipole of this simulation of hydrogen.

A \lstinline{6-311++G(d,p)} basis set corresponds to a \lstinline{6-311++Gss} 
basis set in \lstinline{PySCF}, and we can extract it from here,
\begin{python}
molecule = "
    h 0.0 0.0 -0.6948522960236121;
    h 0.0 0.0  0.6948522960236121
    "
basis = "6-311++Gss"
system = construct_pyscf_system_ao(molecule, basis=basis)
\end{python}
The bond length of the Hydrogen molecule is approximately $0.7354\text{ Å}$, converted 
to multiples of Bohr radii here. As the naming suggests, the basis set is a split-valence 
triple-zeta basis set, with one added s-type diffuse function and a set of p-type
polarisation 
functions for each Hydrogen atom\footnote{This would be obvious for a quantum chemist,
but basis set configurations looks like incantantions from a spellbook to a physicist}.

In their simulations \citeauthor{li2005time} have used a linearly polarised and 
spatially homogenous external field, 
\begin{equation}
    \vb{e}(\vb{r}, t) = \vb{E}(t)\sin(\omega t).
\end{equation}
The field envelope $|\vb{E}|$ is linearly increased with time to a maximum value 
$|\vb{E}_\text{max}|$ at the end of the first cycle and remains at $|\vb{E}_\text{max}|$
for one cycle and then decreases linearly to zero by the end of the next cycle,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \vb{E}(t) = (\omega t / 2\pi) \vb{E}_\text{max} \quad &\text{for} \quad
            0 \leq t \leq 2\pi / \omega \\ 
        \vb{E}(t) = \vb{E}_\text{max} \quad &\text{for} \quad 
            2\pi / \omega \leq t \leq 4\pi / \omega \\ 
        \vb{E}(t) = (3 - \omega t / 2\pi) \vb{E}_\text{max} \quad &\text{for} \quad 
            4\pi / \omega \leq t \leq 6\pi / \omega \\
        \vb{E}(t) = 0 \quad &\text{for} \quad
            t < 0 \text{ and } t > 6\pi / \omega,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the maximum field intensity if $1.72\times10^14 \text{ W} \text{cm}^{-2}$ 
($E_\text{max} = 0.07 \text{ au}$). \citeauthor{li2005time} also run a simulation 
for a lower intensity, but we are conecerned only with this relatively more intensive 
pulse. The entire simulation lasts for $T=225 \text{ au}$.

The result of our simulation is shown in \autoref{fig:li_compare}, where we have 
computed the instantaneous dipole over time using three different methods. The 
time-dependent Hartre-Fock result is shown in the bottom sub-figure, and is expected 
to be exactly the same as figure 4.a from \citeauthor{li2005time}\cite{li2005time},
which it appear to be. For comparrison we have computed the result with both of 
our time-dependent coupled cluster methods. The result of the time-dependent 
coupled cluster method with single and double excitations are showed in the top subfigure,
and the result of the orbital-adaptive coupled cluster method with double excitations 
are shown in the middel subfigure. We see that there is no perceptible difference between 
the results of the three methods.

        basis set.

\section{Zanghellini}

Zanghellini et al.\cite{Zanghellini04} calculate the time development of a 
one-dimensional quantum dot with two electrons using the multi-configurational 
time-dependent Hartree-Fock method (MCTDHF). This method yields excact results for 
a very large number of configurations, $\eta \to \infty$. This study would provide a 
proper benchmark for our implementation because the coupled cluster method with singles and 
doubles excitations (CCSD) is excact for $n=2$ particles. 
The harmonic oscillator potential applied in
their study had a frequency of $\omega=0.25$, used a strong laser-like field with 
maximum intensity of $E = 1$ and a laser frequency of $\Omega = 8 \omega = 2$.
Their MCTDHF scheme convergences with $\eta=15$
configurations up to the resulotion of their figures.
We are able to reproduce their results precisesly by employing the 
time-dependent coupled cluster method with singles and double excitations (TDCCSD) with 
static orbitals, using $l=20$ spin-orbitals in the basis set.

In \autoref{fig:zanghellini_fig1} we see the ground state electron density for the 
ground state wavefunction computed with CCSD. Zanghellini et al. computed the electron
density for an increasing number of configurations $\eta$ using multi-configurational
Hartree-Fock (MCHF). This figure matches the convergent electron density found by Zanghellini et al. 
as $\eta \to \infty$, in figure 1 from their article.

        $n=2$ eletrons and $l=20$ spin-orbitals in the basis set computed with
        CCSD. This plot 
        corresponds precisely with figure 1 in Zanghellini et al.\cite{Zanghellini04}.
    }
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:zanghellini_fig2} depicts the probability fo the system being in the ground 
state as a function of time. Here we have included both a time-dependent Hartree-Fock
computation, corresponding to a MCTDHF computation with $\eta=1$ configurations, and 
a TDCCSD computation, corresponding to MCTDHF when $\eta\to\infty$. We find that our plots
matches Zanghellin et ali's plots in their figure 2 precicely.
