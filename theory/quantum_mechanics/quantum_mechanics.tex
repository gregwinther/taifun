\section{Classical Mechanics}

    The formalism used in quantum mechanics largely stems from William Rowan Hamilton's 
    formulation of classical mechanics. Through the process of canonical
    quantisation any classical model of a physical system is turned into
    a quantum mechanical model.

    In Hamilton's formulation of classical mechanics, a complete description of a system
    of N particles is described by a set of canonical coordinates 
    $q = (\vec{q}_1, \dots, \vec{p}_N)$ and corresponding conjugate momenta
    $p = (\vec{p}_1, \dots \vec{p}_N)$. Together, each pair of coordinate and momentum
    form a point $\xi = (q, p)$ in phase space, which is a space of all possible states
    of the system. Moreover, pairs of generalised coordinates and conjugate
    momenta are canonical if they satisfy the Poisson brackets so that 
    $\{q_i, p_k\} = \delta_{ij}$. The Poisson bracket of two functions is defined as 

    \begin{equation}
        \{f, g\} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\partial g}{\partial g}
        - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\partial g}{\partial q}.
    \end{equation}

    The governing equations of motion in a classical system is Hamilton's equations,

    \begin{align}
        \dot{q} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \mathscr{H}(q, p) \\
        \dot{p} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial q} \mathscr{H}(q, p)
    \end{align}

    where $\mathscr{H}(q, p)$ is the Hamiltonian, a function for the total energy of the
    system. Hamilton's equations may also be stated in terms of the Poisson brackets,

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{dp_i}{dt} = \{p_i, \mathscr{H}\}, \ \frac{dq_i}{dt} = \{q_i, \mathscr{H}\}.
    \end{equation}

    A system consisting of $N$ of equal mass $m$, subject forces caused by an external
    potential, as well as acting on each other with forces stemming from a central
    potetntial $w(q_ij)$ has the following Hamiltonian,

    \begin{equation}
        \mathscr{H}(q, p) = \mathscr{T}(q) + \mathscr{V}(p) + \mathscr{W}(p) 
            = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i} \abs{\vec{p}_i}^2 + \sum_{i} v(\vec{r}_i)
                + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} w(\vec{r_{ij}}).
    \end{equation}

    This Hamiltonian conveniently contains several parts - the kinetic energy, the
    external potential energy and the interaction energy; denoted by $\mathscr{T}$,
    $\mathscr{V}$ and $\mathscr{W}$ respectively.

\section{Canonical Quantisation}

    In order to transition from a classical system to a quantum system, we move from 
    the classucal phase space to the Hilbert space, through the procedure known as 
    canonical, or first\footnote{Second quantisation comes later.}-, quantisation.
    Whilst the state of a classical system is a point in phase space, a quantum state
    is a complex-valued state vector in discrete, infinite dimensional, Hilbert space,
    that is a complete vector space equipped with an inner product. This space
    is most commonly chosen to be the space of square-integrable functions $\Psi$,
    dependent on all coordinates
    
    \begin{equation}
        \Psi = \Psi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N).
    \end{equation}
    
    These functions
    are dubbed wavefunctions and are maps from a point $(x_1, \dots, x_N)$ in
    configuration space to the complex vector space,

    \begin{equation}
        \Psi: X^N \to \mathds{C}.
    \end{equation}

    It has been widely discussed how such an object can represent the state of a 
    particle. The answer is provided by Max Born's probabilistic interpretation,
    which says that $\abs{\Psi(x_1, \dots, x_N)}^2$, gives the probability of finding
    the particle at a certain position. For a situation with one particle in one
    dimension we have,

    \begin{equation}
        \int_a^b \abs{\Psi(x)}^2 dx = 
        \left\{\begin{aligned}
            \text{probability of finding the} \\
            \text{particle between $a$ and $b$}
        \end{aligned}\right\}
    \end{equation}

    while $\abs{\Psi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)}^2$ is the probability density for locating
    all particles at the point $(x_1, \dots x_N) \in X^N$. Since the total probability
    must be 1, we are provided with a normalisation condition for the wavefunction,
    
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{X^N} \abs{\Psi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)}^2 dx_1 dx_2\dots dx_N = \mathds{1}.
    \end{equation}
    
\subsection{The Dirac-von Neumann Postulates}

    The following postulates, or axioms, provide a precise and concise description 
    of quantum mechanics in terms of operators on the Hilbert space. There are
    many variations of these postulates, introduced both by their namesakes 
    Paul Adriene Maurice Dirac\cite{dirac1930principles} and John von 
    Neumann\cite{vonNeumann1932foundations}.

    \paragraph{Hilbert Space}
    A quantum state of an isolated physical system is described by a vector
    with unit norm in a Hilbert space, a complex vector space quipped with a
    scalar product. 

    \paragraph{Observables}
    Each physical observable of a system is accociated with a \emph{hermitian}
    operator acting on the Hilbert space. The eigenstates of each such
    operator define a \emph{complete}, \emph{orthonormal} set of vectors.

    With $\hat{O}$ an operator, hermiticity means,
    \begin{equation}
        \bra{\phi}\hat{O}\psi\rangle = \langle\hat{O}\phi\ket{\psi} \equiv \bra{\phi} \hat{O} \ket{\psi}.
    \end{equation}

    Completeness means,
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_i \ket{i}\bra{i} = \mathds{1}.
    \end{equation}

    Orthonormal means,
    \begin{equation}
        \braket{i}{j} = \delta_{ij}.
    \end{equation}

    \paragraph{Time Evolution}
    The time evolution of the state vector, $\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi (t)}$, is given by the Schrödinger
    equation\footnote{In the Schrödinger picture.}.
    \begin{equation}
        i\hbar \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi (t)} = \hat{H} \ket{\psi (t)}.
    \end{equation}

    \paragraph{Measurements}
    Physically measurable values, associated with an obeservable $\hat{O}$ are defined by the 
    eigenvalues $o_n$ of the observable,
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{O}\ket{n} = o_n\ket{n}.
    \end{equation}
    The probability for finding a particular eigenvalue in the measurement is
    \begin{equation}
        p_n = \abs{\braket{n}{\psi}}^2,
    \end{equation}
    with the system in state $\ket{\psi}$ before the measurement, and $\ket{n}$ as the 
    eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue $o_n$.

\section{The Many-Body Quantum Hamiltonian}

    The full Hamiltionian for a quantum many-body system can be a large 
    and unwieldy thing. In this study we will constrain ourselves to the study of
    electronic systems. Purely on a phenomenological basis, one would include nuclear
    terms in the Hamiltonian as well. In this study however, we will stay within the
    Born-Oppenheimer approximation and treat the nuclei as stationary particles, thereby
    refraining from introducing terms that involve the motion of nuclei. Here we
    introduce the molecular electronic Breit-Pauli Hamiltionian, throrougly described in 
    Helgaker et al.\cite{helgaker2012recent},
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian}
        \hat{H}^{\text{BP}}_{\text{mol}}
        = \begin{cases}
            \hat{H}_{\text{kin}} \quad &\leftarrow \text{kinetic energy} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{cou}} \quad &\leftarrow \text{Coulomb interactions} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{ee}} \quad &\leftarrow \text{external electric field interaction} \\
            + \hat{H}_Z \quad &\leftarrow \text{Zeeman intercations} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{so}} &\leftarrow \text{spin-orbit interactions} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{ss}} &\leftarrow \text{spin-spin interactions} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{oo}} &\leftarrow \text{spin-spin interactions} \\
            + \hat{H}_{\text{dia}} &\leftarrow \alpha^4 \text{diamagnetic interactions}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    
    \paragraph{Kinetic energy}
    The Breit-Pauli kinetic energy term in \autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian} is
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{H}_{\text{kin}}
            = - \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \nabla^2_i - \frac{\alpha^2}{8}\sum_{i} \nabla^4_i,
    \end{equation}
    where the first term is the common classical kinetic energy operator and the second
    term is the relativistic mass-velocity term. This term arises because of the
    dependence of mass on velocity. This is one of the larger relativistic corrections
    for slow electrons. The mass-velocity term is unbounded from below and should not
    be included in variational calculations\cite{kutzelnigg1990perturbation}.


    \paragraph{Coulomb interactions}

    Coulomb interaction terms in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian (\autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian})
    are the following,
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \hat{H}_{\text{cou}} 
                =& -\sum_{iK}\frac{Z_K}{r_{iK}} 
                    + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i \neq j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} 
                    + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{K \neq L} \frac{Z_k Z_L}{R_{KL}} \\
                &+ \frac{\alpha^2\pi}{2} \sum_{iK} Z_{K}\delta (\vb{r}_{iK})
                - \frac{\alpha^2\pi}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \delta (\vb{r}_{ij}) \\
                &+ \frac{2\pi}{3} \sum_{iK}Z_K R^2_K \delta (\vb{r}_{iK})
                    - \frac{1}{3} \sum_{iK}
                        \frac{\tr \Theta_K (3\vb{r}_{iK} \vb{r}^T_{iK} - r^2_{iK}I_3)}
                        {r^5_{ik}}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    The first three terms are the nonrelativistic Coulomb point-charge interactions between
    nucles and electron, electron and electron and nucleus and nucleus, respectively.
    The fourth and fifth terms are the Darwin corrections caused by the Zitterbewegung
    of the electrons. Because the nuclear point-charge model is not always adequate, the
    second-to-last and last term correct errors from this approximation. Here, $R_K$ is 
    the nuclear extent and $\Theta_K$ is the nuclear quadropole moment. These terms are
    important in nuclear resonance studies\cite{kutzelnigg1990perturbation} and nucllear quadropole resonance
    studies\cite{abragam1961principles}.

    \paragraph{External electric field interactions}
    The Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian includes terms that model the effects of an externally
    applied scalar potential $\phi(\vb{r})$,
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:ef_hamiltonian}
        \hat{H}_{\text{ef}}
            = - \sum_i \phi_i
              + \sum_K Z_K\phi_K
              + \frac{\alpha^2}{\phi_K} \sum_i (\nabla_i \cdot \vb{E}_i).
    \end{equation}
    It is often safe to assume that the applied field are quite uniform on the
    molecular scale, and one therefore often expands \autoref{eq:ef_hamiltonian}
    in multipoles,
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{H}_{\text{ef}}
            = Q_{\text{tot}}\phi_0 
            - \vb{\mu}_{\text{tot}} \cdot \vb{E}_0
            - \frac{1}{2}\tr \vb{Q}_{\text{tot}}\vb{V}_0
            + \dots,
    \end{equation}
    where $q_{\text{tot}}$ is the total charge of the molecule, $\vb{\mu}_0$ is the 
    dipole moment, $\vb{Q}_{\text{tot}}$ is the second moment, and $\vb{V}_0$ is the
    electric field gradient. Higher-order terms are only necessary for fields that vary
    greatly in time.

    \paragraph{Zeeman interactions}
    Paramagnetic interactions of the molecule with an externally applied magnetic field
    $\vb{B}$ are described by the Zeeman term in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian
    (\autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian}),
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:zeeman_hamiltonian}
        \hat{H}_Z
            = - \vb{B} \cdot \sum_i \left(
                - \frac{1}{2}\vb{l}_{iO} - \vb{s}_i
                + \frac{1}{2}\alpha^2\vb{s}_i\nabla_i^2
            \right)
            - \vb{B} \cdot \sum_K \vb{M}_K.
    \end{equation} 
    The nuclear part, here represented by the last term in \autoref{eq:zeeman_hamiltonian},
    are on the order of $10^{-3}$ in atomic units. This is much smaller than the electronic
    part, given by the first sum in \autoref{eq:zeeman_hamiltonian}, but the nuclear part is 
    very important in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) computations, where it determines the
    unshielded resonance lines in the spectra. 

    The first term inside the parenthesis in \autoref{eq:zeeman_hamiltonian} corresponds to
    Zeeman interaction with the magnetic moment generated by the orbital angular momentum of
    the electrons, $\vb{l}_{iO} = \vb{r}_{iO} \times \vb{p}_i$. The second and third terms 
    in the paranthesis are electronic contributions to Zeeman effect from the spin of the 
    electrons. The relativistic correction constituted in the third term is important in
    electron paramegnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.

    \paragraph{Spin-orbit interactions}
    Up to second order in the fine-structure constant, the terms that couple motion of eletrons 
    to particle spins in \autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian} are
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \label{eq:spin_orbit_hamiltonian}
            \hat{H}_{\text{so}}
                =& \frac{\alpha^2}{2} \sum_{iK} \frac{Z_K\vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{l}_{iK}}
                        {r^3_{iK}}
                    - \frac{\alpha^2}{2}\sum_{i \neq j} \frac{\vb{s}_i \vb{l}_{ij}}
                        {r^3_{ij}}
                    - \alpha^2 \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{\vb{s}_j \vb{l}_{ij}}
                        {r^3_{ij}} \\
                &+ \alpha^2 \sum_{iK} \frac{\vb{M}_K \cdot \vb{l}_{iK}}{r^3_{iK}}
                    + \frac{\alpha^2}{4} \sum_i (\vb{E}_i \times \vb{p}_i - \vb{p}_i\times\vb{E}_i)
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    When electron spin coupled to magnetic filed induced by other charges i motion we have spin-orbit 
    interaction. The first term in \autoref{eq:spin_orbit_hamiltonian} models nuclear spin-orbit effect, 
    the second term models interaction between the spin of a particle with its own orbit, 
    the third is interaction with other orbits. The fourth term is known as the orbital hyperfin
    operator and couples magnetic moments to the 
    orbital motion of electrons, while the fifth and last term is modles coupling of electric fields 
    and orbits.

    \paragraph{Spin-psin interaction}
    All terms that arises in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltionian (\autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian}) due to 
    coupling between magnetic momenta or spin of two particles are
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \hat{H}_{\text{ss}}
                &= \frac{\alpha^2}{2} \sum_{i \neq j}
                \left[ 
                    \frac{r^2_{ij}\vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{s}_j - 3\vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{r}_{ij}\vb{r}_{ij} \cdot \vb{s}_j}
                            {r^5_{ij}}
                    - \frac{8\pi}{3} \delta(\vb{r}_{ij}) \vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{s}_j
                \right] \\
                &= \alpha^2 \sum_{iK}
                \left[ 
                    \frac{r^2_{iK}\vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{M}_K - 3\vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{r}_{iK}\vb{r}_{iK} \cdot \vb{M}_K}
                            {r^5_{iK}}
                    - \frac{8\pi}{3} \delta(\vb{r}_{iK}) \vb{s}_i \cdot \vb{M}_k
                \right] \\
                &= \frac{\alpha^2}{2} \sum_{K \neq L}
                \left[ 
                    \frac{r^2_{KL} (\vb{M}_K \vb{M}_L - 3(\vb{M}_K \cdot \vb{R}_{KL}) (\vb{R}_{KL} \cdot \vb{M}_L)}
                            {R^5_{KL}}
                \right]
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

    \paragraph{Diamagnetic Interactions}
    The magnitude of effects from diamagnetic interaction in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian 
    (\autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian}) are terms of order $\alpha^4$ or smaller.
    Most of these effects are only important in some cases where strong external magnetic
    fields are applied (NMR, EPR).

    \subsection{Atomic Units}

        In the Hamiltionian above (\autoref{eq:breit_pauli_hamiltonian}), we have grown up
        and set $\hbar = m_e = e = \dots = 1$. This is a result of using atomic units, a
        form of commonly used dimensionless units. To see how these units arise, consider
        the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a Hydrogen atom,

        \begin{equation}
            \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\nabla^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r} \right)
            \phi = E\phi,
        \end{equation}

        where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, equal to Planck's constant divided by 
        $2\pi$; $m_e$ is the mass of the electron, $-e$ is the charge of the electron and 
        $\epsilon_0$ is the permitivity of free space. We make this equation dimensionless by 
        letting $r \to \lambda r'$,

        \begin{equation}
            \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e\lambda^2}\nabla'^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\lambda r'} \right)
            \phi' = E\phi'.
        \end{equation}

        We can factor out the constants in front of the operators, if we choose $\lambda$ so that,

        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e\lambda^2} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \lambda} = E_a
            \to \lambda \frac{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = a_0
        \end{equation}

        where $E_a$ is the atomic unit of energy that chemists call Hartree. Incidently,
        we see that $\lambda$ is just the Bohr radius, $a_0$. If we let $E' = E/E_a$, we 
        obtain the dimensionless Schrödinger equation,

        \begin{equation}
            \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla'^2 - \frac{1}{r'} \right) \phi' = E'\phi'.
        \end{equation}

        Some conversion factors between atomic units and SI units can be found in
        \autoref{tab:atomic_units_conversion}.

    \section{Indistinguishable Particles and Pauli}

        In a quantum system the particles are identical and impossible to tell
        apart, as indicated by several studies (KILDE!!). 
        Feynman: In fact, all electrons are one and the same.
        The probability density
        for the location of particles in a system must therefore be permutation
        invariant,

        \begin{equation}
            \abs{\Psi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_i, x_j x_N)}^2 
            = 
            \abs{\Psi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_j, x_i x_N)}^2.
        \end{equation}

        For any arbitrary permutation, this is equivalent to 

        \begin{equation}
            \Psi(x_1, \dots x_N) 
            =
            e^{i\alpha(\sigma)}\Psi(x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(N)}),
        \end{equation}

        where $\sigma \in S_N$ is some permutation of $N$ indices and $\alpha$ is 
        some real number that may be dependent on $\sigma$.

        The same relation can be written by way of a linear permutation operator,

        \begin{equation}
            (\hat{P_\sigma}\Psi)(x_1, \dots, x_N)
            =
            \Psi(x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(N)}).
        \end{equation}
